**Welcome to my Tic-Tac-Toe Project**

I approached this project by first understanding the requirements for the tic-tac-toe game and translated them into user stories.

**User Stories**
- As a user, I want to sign up for a game account.
- As a user, I want a message to note if I signed up successfully or not.
- As a user, I want to log into my game account.
- As a user, I want a message to note if I logged into my account successfully or not.
- As a user, I want the option to change my password.
- As a user, I want a message to note if my password change was successful or not.
- As a user, I want to be able to log out of my game account.
- As a user, I want a message to note if I logged out successfully or not.
- As a user, I want to get information about my past games.
- As a user, I want to select a box to put my mark down.
- As a user, I want to be able to play against myself.
- As a user, I want a message to note when the game has ended.
- As a user, I want a message to display the final result.

**Tic-Tac-Toe Wireframe**
Afterwards, I created a wireframe of the game:

I then began to code my game.
